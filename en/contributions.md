## Introduction

Everyone is welcome to contribute to the Pletfix framework. 
Would you solve something more elegantly in the framework? Or are you missing a function? 
Then fork the repository and realize your ideas!

### The Pletfix Philosophy

You should follow the proven software design paradigm, in particular:

- [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) - Keep it simple, stupid
- [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) - Donâ€™t repeat yourself
- [Convention over Configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
- [SRP principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) - Single Responsibility Principle

The most important thing for Pletfix is the first point: **Keep it simple**! If you want to implement something, try to 
find the most easiest way with as little code as possible.

> Do not write an insane construct with hundreds of objects and files, if you can also do it with just a few classes!

Also make sure that the external packages you are using are slim as well. Of course, the packages themselves should not 
include tons of other packages.

> Choose third-party packages carefully so that the KISS principle is not violated!
