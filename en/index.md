# Documentation

[Since 0.5.0]

This is the official and community editable documentation for the Pletfix framework. 

## About Pletfix

Pletfix is a modern framework written in PHP, with proven concepts like 
[MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) pattern, [Dependency Injection](di) or
[HTTP Routing](routing) to name just a few. 

The main principle is [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) - Keep it simple, stupid!
What that means? Read the [Contribution Guide](contributions) to learn more Pletfix philosophy.
